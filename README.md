# json-graph

This is an app that demonstrates using a React component
that renders a graph described by a JSON file (`graph.json`).
It uses SVG.

Each point and edge displays a selected property from its metadata.
Dropdowns at the top can be used to select
different metadata properties display.
Hovering over a point or edge displays all the associated metadata.

Buttons at the top enable zooming in, zooming out,
and resetting the zoom level.
